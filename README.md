## A Short Introduction!
This is <b>Samyak Jain</b>, just a guy with keen interest in statistics and maths, or you can say someone who loves toying with data. I graduated an ISC board school with commerce background in Gurgaon, the place I was brought up in. Currently, I'm pursuing Diploma in Data Science by IIT Madras, to learn and gain expertise in machine learning and advanced analytics, the field I'm very passionate about. I recently completed my Under-Graduation in Computer Applications and Economics through University of Delhi.</br></br>
My journey in data science began in the beginning of the last year of my college, when I decided to learn Data Analysis and give it a shot. Ever since my school days, I have always had a knack for mathematics and statistics, and by chance discovered this amazing profession which includes both of these field. Through the python semester of my college, I discovered my capabilities in logic building in programming and debugging, when I developed a 2D platform game using only python. I believe that small increments in knwoledge and skills by studying and practicing everyday in a disciplined manner will make a huge difference in the long term. In my free time, I enjoy wactching well documented videos, playing video games with friends and strength training.
